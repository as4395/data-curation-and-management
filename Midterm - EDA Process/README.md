Using the EDA Case Study as a guide, use one of the five provided datasets to perform an Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) on the dataset you have chosen.

You are expected to:

1. Review the data and provide information about the data, such as shape, description, etc.
2. Do any required data cleaning if necessary.
3. Create at least 3 plots.  Only matplotlib and seaborn libraries can be used.  However, one of each library must
   be used.
   1) EX: Two Seaborn and one matplotlib or vice versa.
4. For each plot, a description of the findings per the visualization will be provided.  Each description must be _at
   least_ two sentences. 

   
The code, plots, and findings will be stored in a Jupyter Notebook.

The Jupyter Notebook will be submitted in Canvas.
